## About Me:

I am **Shreesh Kumar Jha**, a software dev from **Politecnico di Milano**. I have a great experience in C/C++, Rust, Java, Python.

As a **Visiting Research Intern** at **King's College London** under **Dr. Stephen Kell** ....
As a **QIntern**, I worked with **QMap**, a project that is a part of the QWorld Association. My objective was to gather academic resources, review research articles on quantum computing, and classify them according to their difficulty for the **QMap** website, which is published as a subdomain of QWorld. I also developed a beginner's guide quantum computing learning route for **QMap** and worked on building new webpage for QMap.

I am inclined towards **compilers** and **programming language research**, such as understanding code-generations and different stages of compilers. In the realm of quantum computing, I am intrigued by how qubits are utilized to perform multiple calculations simultaneously. One of the exciting concepts I enjoyed reading about is the transmission of cryptic information with quantum computers, which immediately detects unwanted message intercepts.
